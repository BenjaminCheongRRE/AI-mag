# AI-mag: Tutorial

## Goal

This is a simple example how to design an inductor:
* Design computation and optimization
* Result analysis
    * Interactive GUI
    * Pareto fronts exploration

The following inductor is considered.
* Non-solated DC-DC Buck converter
* Converter ratings: 2kW, 400V input voltage, 200V output voltage
* Optimized parameters : frequency, geometry, air gap, number of turns, ripple

## Installation

> **WARNING**: The repository does NOT contain the dataset and the trained ANNs.
> **WARNING**: The dataset and the trained ANNs are only included in the releases.

* Go to the latest release: [download](https://github.com/ethz-pes/AI-mag/releases/latest)
* Download the source code: "Source code (zip)" or "Source code (tar.gz)"
* Unpack the source code
* Download the data: "data.zip" or "data.tar.gz"
* Unpack the data (replace the folder "dataset" and "design")

## Run the Code

* Start MATLAB and go to the corresponding folder
