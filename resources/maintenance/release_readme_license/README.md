# AI-mag: Inductor Optimization with FEM/ANN

[**https://ai-mag.github.io**](https://ai-mag.github.io)

This dataset contains an example of the data generated by the *FEM/AMM Inductor Optimization* tool:
* The 3D FEM datasets (thermal simulations and magnetic simulations)
* The trained ANNs (thermal ANN and magnetic ANN)
* Examples of generated inductor designs

The main purpose of this dataset is:
* to test the code without regenerating the dataset and training the ANNs
* to test the code without having COMSOL installed

The folders 'dataset' and 'design' should be placed inside the source code folder (at the root of the project).

All the releases (code and data) are on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ethz-pes/AI-mag/releases).
